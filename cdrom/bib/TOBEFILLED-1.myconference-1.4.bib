  abstract  = {Neural machine translation (NMT) is becoming increasingly popular as an effective method of automated language translation. However, due to a scarcity of training datasets, its effectiveness is limited when used with low-resource languages, such as Indian languages (ILs). The lack of parallel datasets in Natural Language Processing (NLP) makes it difficult to investigate many ILs for Machine Translation (MT). A data augmentation approach such as Backtranslation (BT) can be used to enhance the size of the training dataset. This paper presents the development of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model for ILs within the context of a MT system. To address the issue of data scarcity, the paper examines the effectiveness of a BT approach for ILs that uses both monolingual and parallel datasets. Experimental results reveal that while the BT has improved the model's performance, however, it is not as significant as expected. It has also been observed that, even though the English-ILs and ILs-English models are trained on the same dataset, the ILs-English models perform better in all evaluation metrics. The reason for this is that ILs frequently differ in sentence structure, word order, and morphological richness from English.},
