  abstract  = {The increasing use of Romanized typing for Indo-Aryan languages on social media poses challenges due to its lack of standardization and loss of linguistic richness. To address this, we propose a sentence-level back-transliteration approach using the LLaMa 3.1 model for Hindi. Leveraging fine-tuning with the Dakshina dataset, our approach effectively resolves ambiguities in Romanized Hindi text, offering a robust solution for converting it into the native Devanagari script.},
