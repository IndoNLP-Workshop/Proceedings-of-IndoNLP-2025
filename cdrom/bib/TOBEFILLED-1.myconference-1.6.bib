  abstract  = {Evaluating Discourse Representation Structure (DRS)-based systems for semantic parsing (Text-to-DRS) and generation (DRS-to-Text) poses unique challenges, particularly in low-resource languages like Urdu. Traditional metrics often fall short, focusing either on structural accuracy or linguistic quality, but rarely capturing both. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary evaluation methodologies---Parse-Generate (PARS-GEN) and Generate-Parse (GEN-PARS)---designed for a more comprehensive assessment of DRS-based systems. PARS-GEN evaluates the parsing process by converting DRS outputs back to the text, revealing linguistic nuances often missed by structure-focused metrics like SMATCH. Conversely, GEN-PARS assesses text generation by converting generated text into DRS, providing a semantic perspective that complements surface-level metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. Using the Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) dataset, we demonstrate our methodology across Urdu, uncovering unique insights into Urdu's structural and linguistic interplay. Findings show that traditional metrics frequently overlook the complexity of linguistic and semantic fidelity, especially in low-resource languages. Our dual approach offers a robust framework for evaluating DRS-based systems, enhancing semantic parsing and text generation quality.},
